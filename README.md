# Simple Web Application

This is a basic web application built to demonstrate a simple deployment process on AWS EC2. The application will be developed using [Flask/Node.js], and Docker will be used for containerization. The final application will be tested locally and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Project Guide

This project will guide you through:
1. Setting up the project repository on GitHub.
2. Writing a simple application.
3. Testing the application locally with Docker.
4. Deploying the application on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Git**: Version control for managing your code.
- **Docker**: For containerizing your application.
- **AWS Account**: For creating and managing EC2 instances.
- **Python 3.x or Node.js** (depending on your application stack).

## Technologies
- **Backend**: [Flask (Python)/Express (Node.js)]
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Setup Instructions
